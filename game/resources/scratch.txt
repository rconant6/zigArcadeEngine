Game Architecture Framework
1. State Machine Framework

Game states (MenuState, PlayingState, PausedState, GameOverState)
Each state has:

enter() method
exit() method
update() method
handle_input() method


State manager to control transitions
States can have sub-states for complex behaviors

2. ECS Structure

Entities: Simple integer IDs, no data
Components: Pure data structures (no logic)

Common components: Position, Velocity, Sprite, Collider, Health
Organized in arrays of structures (AOS) or structures of arrays (SOA)


Systems: Pure logic, operate on component data

RenderSystem, PhysicsSystem, CollisionSystem, etc.
Each system has its own state for optimization



3. Integration Points

State machine controls which ECS systems are active
Systems can trigger state transitions via events
Resource management tied to state lifecycle

4. Memory Management Strategy

Use Zig's allocators wisely

Arena allocator for per-frame data
Pool allocator for frequently created/destroyed entities
General purpose allocator for persistent data


Component pools for efficient component allocation
Entity recycling to minimize allocations

5. Event System

Lightweight pub/sub for decoupled communication
Events can trigger:

State transitions
Component updates
System behaviors



6. Data Layout

Consider data-oriented design principles:

Hot/cold data separation
Cache-friendly component organization
Prefetching opportunities



This structure gives you:

Clean separation of concerns
Excellent performance potential
Easy to understand flow control
Scalable from 2 to 200+ entities without major refactoring




Hand-rolled Graphics Framework
1. Window Management

Cross-platform window creation
Event handling (keyboard, mouse, window events)
Platform-specific message pump

2. Software Rasterizer

Pixel buffer management
Line drawing algorithms
Shape rasterization (ellipses, rectangles, polygons)
Coordinate system transformation (map -1 to 1 to screen space)

3. Color Management

RGBA color handling
Alpha blending
Color space conversions

4. Double Buffering

Implement front/back buffer swapping
Prevent tearing
Manage frame presentation

5. Graphics Pipeline Abstraction

Clear separation between rendering API and engine
Command buffer system for batching draw calls
State management (current color, transform, etc.)

Learning Path
Start with:

Create a window and manage its lifecycle
Allocate and manipulate a pixel buffer
Implement basic line drawing
Build up to more complex shapes
Add color and blending
Integrate with your ECS architecture

By building everything from scratch, you'll understand exactly how every pixel gets to the screen, which will make you a much stronger graphics programmer overall. This foundation will also make using higher-level libraries easier later, as you'll understand what they're doing under the hood.
